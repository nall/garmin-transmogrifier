 *  \mainpage About the LUFA (Formerly MyUSB) Library
 *
 *  Lightweight USB Framework for AVRs Library, written by Dean Camera.
 *
 *  \section Sec_About About this library
 *
 *  Originally based on the AT90USBKEY from Atmel, it is an open-source, driver for the USB-enabled AVR
 *  microcontrollers, released under the MIT license.
 *
 *  Currently supported AVR models:
 *   - AT90USB1286 (USB Device Only)
 *   - AT90USB1287 (USB Host and Device)
 *   - AT90USB646 (USB Device Only)
 *   - AT90USB647 (USB Host and Device)
 *   - AT90USB162 (USB Device Only)
 *   - AT90USB82 (USB Device Only)
 *   - ATMEGA16U4 (USB Device Only)
 *   - ATMEGA32U6 (USB Device Only)
 *   - ATMEGA32U4 (USB Device Only)
 *
 *  Currently supported Atmel boards:
 *   - AT90USBKEY
 *   - STK525
 *   - STK526
 *   - RZUSBSTICK
 *   - ATAVRUSBRF01
 *   - Custom User Boards
 *
 *  The library is currently in a stable release, suitable for download and incorporation into user projects for
 *  both host and device modes. For information about the project progression, check out my blog.
 *
 *  LUFA is written specifically for the free AVR-GCC compiler, and uses several GCC-only extensions to make the
 *  library API more streamlined and robust. You can download AVR-GCC for free in a convenient windows package, 
 *  from the the WinAVR website.

 *  \section Sec_Demos Demos and Bootloaders
 *  The LUFA library ships with several different host and device demos, located in the /Demos/ subdirectory.
 *  If this directory is missing, please re-download the project from the project homepage.
 *
 *  Also included with the library are three fully functional bootloaders, located in the /Bootloaders/ subdirectory.
 *  The DFU class bootloader is compatible with Atmel's FLIP software or the open source dfu-programmer project, the
 *  CDC class (AVR109 protocol) is compatible with such open source software as AVRDUDE and AVR-OSP, and the TeensyLoader
 *  HID class bootloader is compatible with the software from PJRC (http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/index.html).
