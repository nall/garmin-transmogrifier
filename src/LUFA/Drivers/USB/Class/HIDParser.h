/** \ingroup Group_USB
 *  @defgroup Group_HIDParser HID Report Parser
 *
 *  Functions, macros, variables, enums and types related to the parsing of HID class device report descriptors.
 *
 *  The processed HID report is presented back to the user application as a flat structure containing each report
 *  item's IN, OUT and FEATURE (if desired) items along with each item's attributes.
 *
 *  This library portion also allows for easy setting and retrieval of data from a HID report, including devices
 *  with multiple reports on the one HID interface.
 *
 *  By default, FEATURE reports and IN/OUT reports with constant data are ignored in the HID report when processed
 *  to save on memory. This can be overridden by defining the HID_ENABLE_FEATURE_PROCESSING or
 *  HID_INCLUDE_CONSTANT_DATA_ITEMS tokens in the user project makefile, passing them to the compiler via the -D
 *  switch.
