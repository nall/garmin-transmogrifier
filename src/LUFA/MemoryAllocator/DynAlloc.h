 *  The following files must be built with any user project that uses this module:
 *    - LUFA/MemoryAllocator/DynAlloc.c
 *
 *  \section Module Description
 *  Dynamic, auto-defragmenting block memory allocator library. This library provides a convenient replacement for
 *  the standard avr-libc dynamic memory allocation routines. Memory is handed out in block chunks, to reduce the
 *  management memory overhead.
 *
 *  Unlike the normal memory allocation routines, this library gives out handles to memory which must be dereferenced
 *  at the exact time of use, rather than handing back direct memory pointers. By using library managed handles
 *  instead of pointers, allocated memory blocks can be shifted around as needed transparently to defragment the
 *  memory as more blocks are requested.
 *
 *  The memory heap is static, thus the total memory usage of the compiled application (as reported by the avr-size
 *  tool of the AVR-GCC toolchain) includes the dynamic memory heap.
 *
 *  The constants NUM_BLOCKS, BLOCK_SIZE and NUM_HANDLES must be defined in the project makefile (and passed to the
 *  preprocessor via the -D GCC switch) for this library to compile.
 *
 *  NUM_BLOCKS indicates the number of memory blocks in the memory psudoheap which can be chained together and handed
 *  to the application via a memory handle. NUM_HANDLES is the maximum number of memory handles (pointing to one or
 *  more chained memory blocks) which can be handed out simultaneously before requiring a handle (and its associated
 *  memory) to be freed. BLOCK_SIZE gives the number of bytes in each memory block. 
 *
